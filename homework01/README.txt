This folder contains 3 files:
	ex1.py
	ex2.py
	ex3.py

Each of these files contain the code to complete exercises 1-3 for homework 1.
To use them, one must simply run them with the python3 interpreter while in
the TACC coe332 system (I don't know what to formally call it, what we ssh into).
The output of each script is printed to the terminal.
